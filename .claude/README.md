# .claude/

This folder extends Claude Code for this project with **skills** (reusable task templates) and **subagents**
(isolated reviewers). The best-practices section at the bottom is derived from Anthropic's official skills guide.

## Best practices

This guide was autogenerated from best-practices.
You can find more detailed information about best-practices on:

- [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)
- [Complete Guide to Building-Skills](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf?hsLang=en)

### Frontmatter & naming

- `name` must be kebab-case and match the folder name exactly.
- `description` is the trigger: write it so Claude recognises when the skill applies.
- Reserved names: `claude`, `anthropic`.

### Description quality

Structure: `[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key trigger phrases]`.

```yaml
# Good
description: Scaffolds a @JobWorker class. Use when the user asks to create a worker,
  add a service-task handler, or generate an inbound Zeebe adapter.

# Bad
description: Helps with Zeebe.   # Too vague — no trigger phrases
```

### Instruction quality

- Put critical instructions near the top under `## IMPORTANT`.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; move deep reference docs to a `references/` sub-folder.
- Include concrete examples (input → output) and explicit error-handling steps.
- End with: *"If anything is unclear, ask before proceeding."*

### Invocation control

| Frontmatter                      | User can invoke | Claude auto-invokes |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *(default)*                      | Yes             | Yes                 |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes             | No                  |
| `user-invocable: false`          | No              | Yes                 |

Use `disable-model-invocation: true` for skills with side effects (deploy, commit, send messages).

### Progressive disclosure

Keep `SKILL.md` focused on core logic.
Reference material (API docs, style guides, BPMN spec excerpts) belongs in`references/`
It is loaded by Claude only when needed, avoiding context bloat.
