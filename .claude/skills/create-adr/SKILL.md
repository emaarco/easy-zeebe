# Skill: create-adr

Write a new Architectural Decision Record following the MADR format used in `docs/adr/`.

## Usage

```
/create-adr "<short description of the decision>"
```

Example:

```
/create-adr "use bpmn-to-code for process constant generation"
```

## Instructions

### Step 1 – Determine the next ADR number

Use Glob to list all files matching `docs/adr/*.md`. Extract the four-digit numeric prefix from each filename
(e.g. `0001` from `0001-hexagonal-architecture.md`). The next number is the highest existing prefix plus one,
zero-padded to four digits. If no non-template files exist, start at `0001`.

### Step 2 – Derive the filename slug

Convert `$ARGUMENTS` to a kebab-case slug:
- Lowercase all characters
- Replace spaces and underscores with hyphens
- Remove characters that are not alphanumeric or hyphens
- Collapse consecutive hyphens into one

Target file path: `docs/adr/{XXXX}-{slug}.md`

Example: `"use bpmn-to-code for process constant generation"` →
`docs/adr/0002-use-bpmn-to-code-for-process-constant-generation.md`

### Step 3 – Read the template

Read `docs/adr/0000-adr-template.md` as the structural reference.

### Step 4 – Gather content from the user

Ask the user the following (you may ask all at once). Skip any question that `$ARGUMENTS` already answers.

1. **Context**: What is the problem or situation that motivated this decision? What forces or constraints apply?
2. **Decision**: What was decided? State it in one or two clear sentences using active voice.
3. **Positive consequences**: What becomes better or easier as a result?
4. **Negative consequences**: What becomes harder or is accepted as a trade-off?
5. **Neutral consequences** (optional): What simply changes, with no clear positive or negative value?

### Step 5 – Draft the ADR

Compose the ADR using the template structure:
- Title: short imperative phrase derived from `$ARGUMENTS`
- Date: today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Status: `Accepted` by default — ask the user only if they indicate a different status is appropriate
- Context, Decision, Consequences: from Step 4

Show the complete draft to the user before writing.

### Step 6 – Confirm and write

Ask: "Write this ADR to `{target-path}`? (yes / edit / cancel)"

- **yes** → write the file and report the path
- **edit** → apply the user's changes, show the updated draft, and ask again
- **cancel** → stop without writing

### Step 7 – Report

After writing, output:
- The path of the created file
- A reminder to commit the ADR in the same commit as the code change it documents, so the decision and its
  implementation are traceable together in git history
